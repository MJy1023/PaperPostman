### 🌟 MMIE: Massive Multimodal Interleaved Comprehension Benchmark for Large Vision-Language Models

**Authors:** Peng Xia, Siwei Han, Shi Qiu et al.

**Conference:** ICLR.2025

**[Read Paper](/venue/HnhNRrLPwm@OpenReview)**

Interleaved multimodal comprehension and generation, enabling models to produce and interpret both images and text in arbitrary sequences, have become a pivotal area in multimodal learning. Despite significant advancements, the evaluation of this capability remains insufficient. Existing benchmarks suffer from limitations in data scale, scope, and evaluation depth, while current evaluation metrics are often costly or biased, lacking in reliability for practical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce MMIE, a large-scale knowledge-intensive benchmark for evaluating interleaved multimodal comprehension and generation in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). MMIE comprises 20K meticulously curated multimodal queries, spanning 3 categories, 12 fields, and 102 subfields, including mathematics, coding, physics, literature, health, and arts. It supports both interleaved inputs and outputs, offering a mix of multiple-choice and open-ended question formats to evaluate diverse competencies. Moreover, we propose a reliable automated evaluation metric, leveraging a scoring model fine-tuned with human-annotated data and systematic evaluation criteria, aimed at reducing bias and improving evaluation accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and metrics in providing a comprehensive evaluation of interleaved LVLMs. Specifically, we evaluate eight LVLMs, revealing that even the best models show significant room for improvement, with most achieving only moderate results. We believe MMIE will drive further advancements in the development of interleaved LVLMs.

### 🌟 PRIMT: Preference-based Reinforcement Learning with Multimodal Feedback and Trajectory Synthesis from Foundation Models

**Authors:** Ruiqi Wang, Dezhong Zhao, Ziqin Yuan et al.

**Conference:** NeurIPS.2025

**[Read Paper](/venue/4xvE6Iy77Y@OpenReview)**

Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for teaching robots complex behaviors without reward engineering. However, its effectiveness is often limited by two critical challenges: the reliance on extensive human input and the inherent difficulties in resolving query ambiguity and credit assignment during reward learning. In this paper, we introduce PRIMT, a PbRL framework designed to overcome these challenges by leveraging foundation models (FMs) for multimodal synthetic feedback and trajectory synthesis. Unlike prior approaches that rely on single-modality FM evaluations, PRIMT employs a hierarchical neuro-symbolic fusion strategy, integrating the complementary strengths of vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) in evaluating robot behaviors for more reliable and comprehensive feedback. PRIMT also incorporates foresight trajectory generation to warm-start the trajectory buffer with bootstrapped samples, reducing early-stage query ambiguity, and hindsight trajectory augmentation for counterfactual reasoning with a causal auxiliary loss to improve credit assignment. We evaluate PRIMT on 2 locomotion and 6 manipulation tasks on various benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance over FM-based and scripted baselines. Website at https://primt25.github.io/.

### 🌟 Molmo and PixMo: Open Weights and Open Data for State-of-the-Art Vision-Language Models

**Authors:** Matt Deitke, Christopher Clark, Sangho Lee et al.

**Conference:** CVPR.2025

**[Read Paper](/venue/Deitke_Molmo_and_PixMo_Open_Weights_and_Open_Data_for_State-of-the-Art@CVPR2025@CVF)**

Today's most advanced vision-language models (VLMs) remain proprietary. The strongest open-weight models rely heavily on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs to achieve good performance, effectively distilling these closed VLMs into open ones. As a result, the community has been missing foundational knowledge about how to build performant VLMs from scratch. We present \textbf{Molmo}, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art in their class of openness. Our key contribution is a collection of new datasets, including a dataset of highly detailed image captions for pre-training called \textbf{PixMo}, a free-form image Q\&A dataset for fine-tuning, and an innovative 2D pointing dataset, all collected without the use of external VLMs. The success of our approach relies on careful modeling choices, a well-tuned training pipeline, and, most critically, the quality of our newly collected datasets. Our best-in-class 72B model not only outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models, but also outperforms larger proprietary models including Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5 Pro and Flash, second only to GPT-4o based on both academic benchmarks and on a large human evaluation. Our model weights, new datasets, and source code will all be released.
